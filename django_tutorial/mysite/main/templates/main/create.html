<!--
Posts and get have different security
Post has more secure encryption
use for putting information into db

Get can be used for information retrival 
Maybe if you want to bookmark the particular tab and revisit it. that's when post can be used
get puts information onto the url. and reads from it
Oversimplification: that is why post is more secure than get
